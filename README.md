# Dialectal-Semantics

### Description
The purpose of this project was to measure semantic variations in word meanings across dialects of English. This work builds off the work of [(Thompson, Roberts, \& Lupyan 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0924-8) which suggest that there exist semantic variations across languages.

### Technical Approach
This project entailed the training of deep learning language models (word2vec) and using them to assess semantic alignments between dialectal variations of English. Assessment of semantic alignment followed the same procedure as used in [(Thompson et al. 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0924-8) using vector cosines and pearson correlations to measure alignment of semantic domains.
